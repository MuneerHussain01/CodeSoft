Task 01 : CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED  RESPONSES 

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.

Task 3: IMAGE CAPTIONING
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.

TASK 5: FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION
Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
