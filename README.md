Task 01 : CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED  RESPONSES 

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.
